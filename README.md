# Tic-Tac-Toe

### 1st step

Set up the HTML structure for the Tic Tac Toe game.

### 2nd step

Styled the game with a dark theme and made it responsive.

### 3rd step 

The board element has an event listener added to it that listens for clicks and calls the handleClick function when a cell is clicked. The handleClick function places the current player's mark on the board and checks if the player has won the game by calling the checkForWin function. If the player has won, the gameOver variable is set to true to end the game. If the player has not won, the function switches to the other player by toggling the value of the currentPlayer variable.
